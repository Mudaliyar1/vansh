            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits and manifests in various forms.
                Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public schools, following a
                curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal
                schooling
                system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and
                non-formal
                education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary
                education,
                and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and
                student-centered education,
                and on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical education. Additionally,
                the term "education" can
                denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals and the academic field studying
                educational phenomena.

                    Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or preceptor after initiation.
                    The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between the Guru and his Shishya
                    (students /disciples) was a very important part of education.Taxila is an example of an ancient
                    higher
                    learning institute in ancient India, possibly dating as far back as the 8th century BCE. However,
                    it is debatable whether or not this can be regarded as a university in modern-day terms, since the
                    teachers
                    living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to
                    have
                    existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later
                    Nalanda
                    university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of e
                    ducation in the world in the modern sense of university, and all subjects there were taught in the
                    Pali language.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">India's All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) reported,
                    in 2013
                    that there are more than 4,599 vocational institutions that offer degrees, diploma and post-diploma
                    in architecture, engineering, hotel management, infrastructure, pharmacy, technology, town services
                    and others. There were 1,740,000 students enrolled in these schools.[89]
                    Total annual intake capacity for technical diplomas and degrees exceeded 3.4 million in
                    2012.[citation needed]
                    According to the University Grants Commission (UGC) total enrolment in Science, Medicine,
                    Agriculture and
                    Engineering crossed 65 lakh in 2010. The number of women choosing engineering has more than doubled
                    since 2001.
